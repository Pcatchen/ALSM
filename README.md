Applied Linear Statistical Models
=================================

This R package provides data and code for all of the tables and figures, to the extent I've completed them. Nearly all examples are provided, save for some advanced materials I wasn't prepared for some years ago when I coded this (e.g., neural networks). These will be updated in later versions of this package.  

This project began several years ago to teach myself how to use R and (applied) statistics. The code base has not been updated much, and definitely does not reflect my current "best" (better) coding practices. As this package gets updated, the code base will reflect better standards. 

Coming soon: package functions for those used in the vignettes that encapsulate the book's logic and are not existing functions in R or were used to demonstrate the methodology. Some functions are utilities for easier reuse, such as repeated plots to match the book's figures.

Vignettes are complete, but the code base will require cleanup. Some package dependencies will be removed, such as rcmdr. Lattice plots may be converted to ggplot alternatives. Milestones will be set to track further inclusion of chapters beyond 18. Demos will be generated from the vignette's code script directly. This will maintain consistency between the two modes of presentation. Demos are there for the interested user; they're not the recommended mode of learning.
