Applied Linear Statistical Models
=================================

This R package provides data and code for all of the tables and figures, to the extent I've completed them. Besides the section on neural networks (that I can do now!), all work is done up through chapter 18. 

This project began several years ago to teach myself how to use R and (applied) statistics. The code base has not been updated, and definitely does not reflect my current "best" (better) coding practices. The code also does not use the current package structure or internal data to perform the computations (yet). These will be updated in time.

Things to expect

1.  Code that actually uses the packaged data
2.  Proper package commenting throughout
3.  Deliver the examples through the `demo` utility, such as `demo("ch1", "ALSM")`
4.  Delivery the examples through vignettes (this may be a "code-less" package then!)
